    It is a highly debating topic that whether university students should take extra subjects addtion to core subjects. From my point of view, we shouldn't be limited to one subject, it's the mixed background students that outstand.

    It's well known that  there is a huge pressure of recruitment nowadays, given that one's time is limited, taking extra subjects would definitely distract them and take up their time originally used on the main subject, so it is no confusion some students agree to spend no efforts studying for a qualification, even holidays would be seen as a waste of time. The more time they spend on the main subjects, the less burden they will get.

    But that is only part of the story, perhaps the most crucial thing in the era of AI is the ability to use different aspects of knowledge and then turn them into productivity. If students take subjects in various types, it is natural for them to conbine what they have learned into brand new solution in face of challenge, which make them outperformed than others. If I were the employer, with similar level of salary,I would definitely enroll someone in a mixed background, who will burst creativity and broaden horizons in my company. On the other hand, you will never know when and where the addtional subjects will be applied in the future, maybe the philosophy you've learnt will bring you out of depreesion one day, or perhaps the management skill you've once felt boring play an significant role when you estabilish a startup. And most importantly, it is university that we can learn something unrelevant to our fixed route at barely no cost. 

    For conservative ones, giving all time on the main subject seems promising. But if you have time and energy,why not put your eggs in different baskets?

    It is a topic of much debate that whether university students should devote all their time to their core subjects or expand their horizons by exploring additional disciplines. From my point of view, embracing an interdisciplinary approach yields substantial benefits, though there are definitely compelling reasons for focusing solely on one’s major area of study. 
    
    On the one hand, given students have limited time in university, taking extra subjects might distract them and diminish the time spent on the main subject.  Thus, it is not surprising that some students spare no effort studying for a qualification, especially with the massive competition in the job market nowadays. The more time they spend on the main subjects, the less pressure they will feel.

    On the other hand, the indispensable skill in the age of artificial intelligence is the capacity to amalgamate expertise from various disciplines and translate it into tangible output. If students take subjects in a wide range of fields, they can naturally combine what they have learned to develop innovative solutions when facing challenges, which makes them outperform others. If I were an employer, I would certainly hire someone in a diverse background  with a similar salary, who would bring creativity and broaden perspectives in my company. You never know when the additional subjects may come in handy in the future. Possibly the philosophy you have grasped will help you overcome depression one day, or possibly the management skill you once found boring plays a significant role when you establish a startup. And most importantly, it is the university that we can learn something unrelated to our fixed route with almost no cost. 

    For conservative students, dedicating all time to the main subject appears advantageous. But if you have time and energy, why not put your eggs in different baskets?

    For conservative ones, giving all time on the main subject seems promising. But if you have time and energy,why not put your eggs in different baskets?Students attend university to improve their prospects and find suitable employment after graduation. For this reason, some feel that they should focus all their energy on their main subjects to gain a relevant qualification. Others want a more well-rounded education, so they try to learn about additional subjects.

    It is perfectly reasonable for students to enter university with a strong sense of curiosity and a desire to learn as much as possible. Unfortunately, we tend to put subjects into artificial boxes, suggesting that business, art and science are not connected. If students become too focused on a single area, it may stifle their initial curiosity, limiting their potential. They could also graduate with a very narrow skill set that doesn't translate well to the current job market, which often favours those who have taken a multidisciplinary approach to their studies.

    Despite this, caution is certainly needed. The more we learn about a subject, the more complex it becomes. Gaining an in-depth, specialist knowledge of a subject requires a certain level of focus and dedication over a long period. If we try to learn about too many things at once, our Knowledge may lack the depth required to obtain a qualification. If they are not careful, young people could begin to lose interest in their main subjects, which would be detrimental to their studies.

    While learning about other subjects is not necessarily a bad thing, I believe university students should ensure that their main subjects remain the priority so that they do not lose sight of their objective: gaining a qualification. Then they can calculate how much time, energy and headspace they have left for learning about other topics.
