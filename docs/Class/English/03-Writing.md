作文的训练步骤：

1. 先看网课，了解大致情况并了解作文结构逻辑；总结结构逻辑并列出自己准备使用的结构逻辑是啥样的；
2. 训练：上手写作文，这时不用限时，目标是自然地使用模板和句式积累，同时尽可能用上自己搜集的句式和词语，多用几次才会熟练不用背诵；
3. 纠错：找自己写的比较好的用了很多模板的几篇作文，用AI或者付费网站批改，根据他给的建议进行更新和改正模板和句式；
4. 积累：看高分模板，句式库，写自己的模板和句式积累；看高分满分作文，自己按照题目列提纲，只用写逻辑和分论点，然后看范文的思路和其中的高分句式结构（这时可能对自己的结构逻辑还会有微调）
5. 计时练习：在自己独有的模板句式都比较熟练后，就要计时，小作文20-22min，大作文40-42min完成。

It is a topic of much debate that whether university students should devote all their time to their core subjects or expand their horizons by exploring additional disciplines. From my point of view, embracing an interdisciplinary approach yields substantial benefits, though there are certainly compelling reasons for focusing solely on one’s major area of study. 

On the one hand, given students have limited time in university,taking extra subjects might distract them and deminish the time spent on the main subject.  Thus, it is not surprising that some students spare no efforts studying for a qualification, especially with the massive competition in the job market nowadays. The more time they spend on the main subjects, the less pressure they will feel.

On the other hand, the most crucial thing in the era of AI is the ability to integrate knowledge from different fields, and convert them into productivity. If students take subjects in a wide range of fields, they can naturally  combine what they have learned to develop innovative solutions when facing challenges, which makes them outperform others. If I were the employer, with similar level of salary,I would definitely hire someone with a diverse background, who would bring creativity and broaden perspectives in my company. You never know when the addtional subjects may come in handy in the future. Maybe the philosophy you've grasped will help you overcome depreesion one day, or perhaps the management skill you've once felt boring play a significant role when you establish a startup. And most importantly, it is the university that we can learn something unrelated to our fixed route with almost no cost. 

For conservative students, dedicating all time on the main subject appears advantageous. But if you have time and energy,why not put your eggs in different baskets?
