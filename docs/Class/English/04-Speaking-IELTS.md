introduce one book


One of the most interesting non-fiction books I’ve read is The Lady Tasting Tea, written by David Salsburg. It’s a book about the history of statistics — but don’t worry, it’s not as boring as it sounds!

It actually tells the story of how statistics became a powerful scientific tool. The title comes from a real event, where a woman claimed she could tell whether milk was poured into a cup before or after the tea. A statistician, Ronald Fisher, designed an experiment to test her claim — and that’s where modern experimental design started!

What I really liked about this book is how it makes complex ideas easy to understand. It introduces big names in statistics, like Fisher, Neyman, and Pearson, but in a way that feels like storytelling rather than a textbook.

Also, it helped me understand how statistics isn’t just about numbers — it’s about thinking critically, asking the right questions, and making decisions based on evidence.
