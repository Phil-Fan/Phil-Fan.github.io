引用一段John Denero 说的话

> When I was getting married, I was a PhD student at the time. My mom pulled me aside on my wedding day and said "John I want to give you some advice". I was like oh she's going to like tell me to listen to my wife or whatever. But she didn't. She said only two words that have stuck with me for a long time. She said **"don't compare"**. That's all. And then she was like okay you can go back to do whatever you're doing. At the time this was very hard for me to process because I was in a university which is all about comparing people based on like what their exam score was. It turns out that out there in the world, there are no exams that everybody takes that are standardized anymore. All that matter is what you go and get done on your own particular path. So, comparing yourselves to other people becomes meaningless rapidly as what really matter is what you could do yourself, like what you're capable of and what you bother to do and how you choose to spend your time. It took years of this two-word phrase "don't compare" to marinate inside of me and for me to realize that my self-worth really has nothing to do with what other people can do or whether I can do it better than them or worse than them. It has everything to do with what i've done and what i'm gonna do next and how I spend my time and better myself. I should just focus on improving myself and forget about what everybody else is doing. 











认识自己与学会认识自己希腊德尔菲的阿波罗神庙里，刻着三句箴言，其中一句是“认识你自己”。所谓认识自己，在我看来包括：知道自己是一个什么样的人，知道自己的优点是什么、弱点是什么，知道自己想成为一个什么样的人，知道自己内心的渴望。就如同之前和我浙一位同学交流时我所说的那样，我认为人生就像是在做数学中的优化一样，最重要的是找到自己的优化目标和约束条件，然后才能在满足约束条件的前提下去优化自己的目标。所谓的优化目标，就是自己内心的渴望，自己真正想奉献一生的事情；所谓约束条件，就是自己必须要满足的前提目标（我记得自己在知乎上看到过一个观点几乎一模一样的回答，但是一时找不到了）。而现在的大学教育，我似乎完全看不到对认识自己的强调，而同学们（包括我自己）也往往是有些麻木地顺着前人“成功”的轨迹，按部就班地刷着GPA、找着实习、去追求一份世俗意义上“成功”的工作；抑或是去找研究实习，去发表论文然后去读博士。有多少人是真正思考自己人生的目标，真正思考过自己是什么样的人的呢？又有多少学校与老师会去告诉学生认识自己的重要性呢？
